method         self.make = make         self.model = model         
self.year = year     def start(self):  
        print("The", self.year, self.make, self.model, "is starting.")     
def stop(self):  
        print("The", self.year, self.make, self.model, "is 
stopping.") car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry", 2022) car2 =
